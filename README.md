# influence-maximization
In collaboration with Dr. Zachary Boyd in the Mathematics Department at BYU, I've contributed to groundbreaking research in the field of graph theory, specifically focused on the exciting realm of maximizing influence in graph structures. Our work delves into the intricate world of network dynamics, exploring how the spread of information, ideas, or influence can be optimized within various contexts.

Our research isn't limited to the realm of mathematics; its implications ripple across diverse domains, including marketing strategies, political campaigns, and the dynamics of social media. Join us on this journey as we uncover novel insights and solutions that have the potential to reshape how we understand and harness influence in real-world networks.
